                    <h5>PROF. DR. CHAUDHRY ABDUL REHMAN</h5>
                    <p>Facilitating Superior Human Beings was our initiative behind inception of the Superior<br> College Lahore. We always wanted to create a difference in people’s lives through our<br> passionate contributions. Our students are a valuable human capital of Pakistan and<br> we dreamt of making students superior by inculcating in them sense of purpose,<br> innovation and creativity, teamwork, excellence, and rewards for performance. These<br> values give our students true essence of life, success and immortality.</p>
                    <div class="collapse" id="demo">
                        <p>
                            I have always believed in Allah’s oneness and his messages have always inspired me.<br> “Man gets whatever he strives for” has been my guiding force. My real hero my dad<br> taught me to live life of a lion and I followed his footsteps. My all initiatives are<br> reflected through my dauntless actions. From Superior College to the Superior group,<br> from Management Sciences to IT, from Allied Health Sciences to Law, from Economics<br> to Engineering, Pharmacy to Mass Communication and Aviation to MBBS, this journey<br> has been transforming impossibilities into possibilities.<br>
                            The emphasis of research and starting international research conferences were a sign<br> that we are here to create an impact. Azra Naheed Center for Research and<br> Development provided a platform for young researchers to experiment the risks to<br> run for their dreams and Chaudhry Muhammad Akram Center for entrepreneurship<br> development is making our students self-reliant and is changing mind sets to be the <br>master of their own fate and captain of their soul. Our social responsibility through<br> Chaudhry Muhammad Akram Teaching and Research Hospital is winning hearts of<br> community in providing them the basic medical facilities.<br>
                            Our work is evident through our focus on plan IQ and EQ which makes us an invincible<br> institute because this mind and heart collaboration always creates a magic of its own.<br> History of Superior is inundated with Superior values which are depicted in every<br> initiative we take. The overall superior environment is an emblem of excellence which<br> rewards individuals and encourages them to leave their impact on the society. This <br>journey of creating miracles with a miraculous team and developing respectable<br> creative, excellent human being are those attributes which surely makes me proud.<br> Our life is Superior and we need to live it to the maximum by discovering a Superior in<br> ourselves. I view every obstacle as an opportunity and this characteristic can surely be<br> found in my every Superior member.<br>
                            I dream of an educated emancipated energetic Pakistan. Every day I move closer to<br> my dream and hope that our Superior endeavors create a Superior generation which<br> untimely develops a Superior Pakistan.<br>
